# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)


If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```

## Network layer (Axios)
A production-grade HTTP client is provided at `src/lib/httpClient.ts` and high-level helpers in `src/lib/api.ts`.

- Base URL: configure via `.env` as `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com` (defaults to `https://example.com`).
- Auth: set a token with `setAuthToken(token)`; it will be sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Errors: all errors reject with a unified `ApiError` containing `status`, `code`, `details`, and optional `requestId`.
- Retries: GET/HEAD/OPTIONS retry up to 2 times on network timeouts with exponential backoff.
- Cancellation: pass an `AbortSignal` in options (`{ signal }`).
- Logging: minimal request/response logs in dev mode.

### Quick usage
```ts
import { httpGet, httpPost, setAuthToken } from './src/lib/api';

setAuthToken('your_jwt');

// GET example
const { data } = await httpGet<{ items: string[] }>("/items", { params: { page: 1 } });

// POST example
await httpPost("/auth/login", { email: "a@b.com", password: "secret" }, { withAuth: false });
```
